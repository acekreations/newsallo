# Express-React-Node Boilerplate

Unfortunately it takes a lot of work to get a React app with a Node backend up and running,

This is a barebones boilerplate for starting an [Express](http://expressjs.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) app. It also includes [React Router Dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom). It does not include any paricular database or ORM/ODM.

## Setup

To get this boilerplate up and running run `yarn install` in the root directorary to install all dependencies.

## Run

To start the app run `yarn start` from the root directory, you should now see "Hello World" at http://localhost/3000.

## Notes

It's worth noteing that in this Hello World example the "Hello World" being display is actually coming from an API call to the backend; I realize this is completely uncessary but it helps create a more complete template for starting your porject.
